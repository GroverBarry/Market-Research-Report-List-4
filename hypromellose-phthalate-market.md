<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hypromellose Phthalate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HP-55</li><li>HP-50</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hypromellose phthalate (HP) is a cellulose derivative used in pharmaceuticals as a coating agent for drug delivery. HP-55 and HP-50 are two different types of hypromellose phthalate with varying degrees of phthalyl substitution. HP-55 has a higher degree of substitution compared to HP-50, making it more suitable for enteric coatings that protect drugs from stomach acid. HP-50, on the other hand, is used for sustained-release formulations. Both types of HP provide excellent film-forming properties and are commonly used in oral pharmaceutical formulations.</p></p>
