<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Adaptive Servo Ventilators ASV Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Volume Triggered</li><li>Flow Triggered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Adaptive Servo Ventilators (ASV) are advanced respiratory devices with two main market types - Volume Triggered and Flow Triggered. Volume Triggered ASVs deliver a set volume of air to the patient's lungs based on their respiratory rate. Flow Triggered ASVs, on the other hand, adjust the flow of air in real-time based on the patient's breathing patterns. Both types of ASVs provide personalized and adaptive respiratory support to patients with varying breathing needs, improving ventilation efficiency and patient comfort.</p></p>
