<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Voltage Controlled Resistor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>JFET</li><li>MOSFET</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Voltage controlled resistors can be classified into two main types: JFET controlled resistors and MOSFET controlled resistors. JFET controlled resistors utilize junction field-effect transistors to control the resistance based on the input voltage. On the other hand, MOSFET controlled resistors use metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors to vary the resistance according to the applied voltage. Both types offer precise control over resistance levels, making them popular choices in electronic circuits where variable resistance is required for precise voltage regulation.</p></p>
