<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive ECS Height Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Sensor</li><li>Active Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive ECS height sensors are commonly divided into two types: passive sensors and active sensors. Passive sensors measure the height of the vehicle based on the expansion or contraction of materials in response to changes in pressure or temperature. Active sensors, on the other hand, utilize electronic components to actively send and receive signals to measure the vehicle's height accurately. Both types of sensors play a crucial role in maintaining the stability and performance of the vehicle's suspension system.</p></p>
