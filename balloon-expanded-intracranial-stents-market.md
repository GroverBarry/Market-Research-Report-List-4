<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Balloon expanded Intracranial Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Stents</li><li>Closed-Loop Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Balloon expanded Intracranial Stents are used in the treatment of intracranial stenosis. There are two main types of these stents - Open Loop Stents and Closed-Loop Stents. Open Loop Stents are designed with an open lattice structure that allows for flexibility and conformability to the vessel wall, whereas Closed-Loop Stents are more rigid and provide higher radial strength. Both types of stents are used to provide support and maintain blood flow in the narrowed or blocked intracranial arteries, ultimately reducing the risk of stroke.</p></p>
