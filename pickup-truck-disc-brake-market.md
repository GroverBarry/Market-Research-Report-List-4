<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pickup Truck Disc Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Opposed Piston</li><li>Floating Caliper</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pickup truck disc brake market consists of two main types: opposed piston and floating caliper. Opposed piston systems utilize multiple pistons on both sides of the brake rotor to apply pressure evenly, providing better braking performance and heat dissipation. Floating caliper systems have a single piston that moves within the caliper, applying pressure to one side of the rotor. While simpler in design, floating calipers may not provide as precise braking control as opposed piston systems. Both types offer unique advantages and are popular choices in the pickup truck market.</p></p>
