<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The MEMS Foundry Service Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pure Play Model</li><li>IDM Model</li></ul></p>
<p><p>MEMS Foundry Service Market Types include the Pure Play Model and the IDM Model. In the Pure Play Model, companies specialize solely in MEMS foundry services and do not produce their own MEMS products. This allows them to focus on providing high-quality manufacturing services to a wide range of customers. In contrast, the IDM Model involves companies that both design and fabricate their own MEMS products in-house. This integrated approach can offer more control over the production process but may limit the ability to provide services to external clients.</p></p>
