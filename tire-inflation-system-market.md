<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tire Inflation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual</li><li>Automatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tire Inflation System market consists of two main types: manual and automatic systems. Manual systems require the user to manually inflate the tire to the desired pressure using a gauge and air pump. Automatic systems, on the other hand, have sensors that monitor tire pressure and automatically inflate or deflate the tires to maintain the correct pressure. Manual systems are typically cheaper and simpler, while automatic systems offer convenience and ease of use. Both types have their own advantages and are used in different applications based on user preference.</p></p>
