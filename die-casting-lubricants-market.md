<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Die Casting Lubricants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Die Lubricants</li><li>Plunger Lubricants</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Die casting lubricants are essential for the efficiency and quality of die casting processes. There are three main types of die casting lubricants - die lubricants, which are sprayed onto the mold cavity to prevent sticking and ensure smooth release of the part, plunger lubricants, which are used to reduce friction between the plunger and the metal during injection, and other lubricants that serve specific purposes such as protecting the mold from corrosion or improving surface finish. Each type of lubricant plays a critical role in ensuring successful die casting operations.</p></p>
