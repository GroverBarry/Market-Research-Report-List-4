<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PV Solar Tracker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-axis</li><li>Dual axis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PV Solar Tracker market is segmented into two main types: Single-axis and Dual-axis. Single-axis trackers pivot on one axis, usually east to west, allowing solar panels to follow the sun's path across the sky. This type is more cost-effective and widely used in the market. Dual-axis trackers pivot on two axes, both north to south and east to west, ensuring panels are always perpendicular to the sun's rays. Despite being more expensive, dual-axis trackers offer higher energy efficiency and are suitable for locations with variable sun angles.</p></p>
