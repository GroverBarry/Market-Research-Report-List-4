<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Air Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double Balanced Shaft Gear</li><li>Single Balance Shaft Gear</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive air brake market includes two main types: double balanced shaft gear and single balance shaft gear. Double balanced shaft gear systems use two shafts that rotate in opposite directions to provide balanced braking force on each side of the vehicle. Single balance shaft gear systems utilize one shaft to distribute braking force evenly. Both types of systems are crucial for maintaining safety and control in heavy-duty vehicles such as trucks and buses. The choice between the two depends on the specific requirements and preferences of the vehicle manufacturer.</p></p>
