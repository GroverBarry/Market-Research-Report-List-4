<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Control Glass Units Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbing Solar Control Glass</li><li>Reflective Solar Control Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solar control glass units are designed to reduce the amount of heat and glare that enters a building while still allowing natural light to pass through. There are two main types of solar control glass: absorbing solar control glass, which absorbs and re-radiates solar energy, and reflective solar control glass, which reflects solar energy away from the building. Absorbing solar control glass is typically darker in color, while reflective solar control glass has a metallic or mirrored appearance. Both types help improve energy efficiency and provide a more comfortable indoor environment.</p></p>
