<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pressure Relief Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reclosing Pressure Relief System</li><li>Nonreclosing Pressure Relief System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pressure Relief Systems are classified into two main types: Reclosing Pressure Relief Systems and Nonreclosing Pressure Relief Systems. Reclosing Pressure Relief Systems are designed to automatically reset and close after the pressure is relieved. They are commonly used in systems that require continuous operation. On the other hand, Nonreclosing Pressure Relief Systems do not automatically reset and close after pressure relief. They are typically used in systems where manual intervention is required to reset the relief system. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring safety and preventing overpressure in various industrial applications.</p></p>
