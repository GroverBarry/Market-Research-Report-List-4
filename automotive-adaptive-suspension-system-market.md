<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Adaptive Suspension System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-active Suspension System</li><li>Active Suspension System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive adaptive suspension system market consists of two main types: semi-active suspension systems and active suspension systems. Semi-active suspension systems use electronically-controlled shock absorbers to adjust damping levels based on driving conditions, offering a balance of comfort and handling. Active suspension systems, on the other hand, use sensors and hydraulic actuators to actively control each wheel's movements, providing superior ride comfort and handling capabilities. Both systems offer improved ride quality and performance compared to traditional passive suspension systems.</p></p>
