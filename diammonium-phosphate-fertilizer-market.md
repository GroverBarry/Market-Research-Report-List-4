<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diammonium Phosphate Fertilizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Crystalline</li><li>Granular</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Diammonium phosphate fertilizer is available in two main types: Crystalline and Granular. Crystalline diammonium phosphate is produced by a precipitation process, resulting in a fine, powdery texture that dissolves easily in water. Granular diammonium phosphate is formed by compacting the crystalline form into larger, spherical pellets, making it easier to handle and spread. Both types are popular choices among farmers for their high nitrogen and phosphorus content, essential for promoting healthy plant growth and increased crop yields.</p></p>
