<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laser Mirror Substrate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flat</li><li>Convex</li><li>Concave</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laser mirror substrates come in three main types - flat, convex, and concave. Flat mirrors have a smooth surface that reflects light without distorting it. Convex mirrors bulge outward and are used to focus or concentrate light. Concave mirrors curve inward and can either diverge or converge light rays. Each type of mirror substrate serves a specific purpose in laser applications, whether it is for directing, focusing, or spreading light for various industrial, scientific, or medical uses.</p></p>
