<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Systemic Herbicide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Selective Herbicide</li><li>non-Selective Herbicide</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Systemic herbicides are categorized into two main types based on their selectivity. Selective herbicides are designed to target specific types of plants while leaving other plants unharmed. These are commonly used in agriculture to control weeds without affecting crops. On the other hand, non-selective herbicides are designed to kill all types of plants they come into contact with. These are commonly used in non-crop areas like sidewalks, driveways, and fences to clear out unwanted vegetation.</p></p>
