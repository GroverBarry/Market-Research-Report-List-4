<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Inverters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Independent Model</li><li>Integrated Model</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solar inverters can be classified into two main market types: Independent Model and Integrated Model. Independent Model inverters are standalone devices that convert DC power generated by solar panels into AC power. They are commonly used in off-grid systems or for specific applications where a separate inverter is required. Integrated Model inverters, on the other hand, are built into the solar panels themselves, offering a more streamlined and space-saving solution. They are typically used in grid-tied systems where space efficiency is a priority.</p></p>
